AT+CGDCONT is an AT command used to define a PDP (Packet Data Protocol) context, which tells the modem how to connect to the mobile data network.

An APN (Access Point Name) is like a gateway that your modem uses to connect to the internet via your mobile carrier.

Examples of APNs:

Jio: jionet

Airtel: airtelgprs.com

Vodafone Idea: www

BSNL: bsnlnet

Without the correct APN, your modem cannot access mobile data.

AT+CGDCONT=<cid>,<PDP_type>,<APN>[,<PDP_addr>[,<d_comp>,<h_comp>]]

AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","jionet"

Tells the modem to use context ID 1, PDP type IP, and APN jionet.

This is typically required before dialing a data connection using ATD*99#.
