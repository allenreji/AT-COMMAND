THE TASK WAS TO CHECK CERTAIN COMMANDS ON CELER SMS AT EMULATOR THE TASK INCULDE CHECKING SIM STATUS, SIM PORT, SENDING MESSAGE AND RECEVING IT

ON CELER SMS UPTO SENDING MESSAGE WORKS BUT SHOWS ERROR FOR CHECKING THE RECEVIED MESSAGES TO FIX THIS DOING IT ON OTHER AT EMULATOR VIA VIRTUAL PORT OR USING REAL HARDWARE MODULE HELPS

I WAS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE BASICS OF SIM STATUS CHECKING AND HOW TO SEND A MESSAGE USING COMMANDS.
